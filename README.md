Ethernet shield provides you instant Internet connectivity with a high spec Ethernet controller, W5200, with twice the buffer size of v1.0 and support for up to eight simultaneous TCP/UDP connections. An included SD slot enables applications that require storing large amounts of data, like IoT data logging. Thanks to a lowered RJ45 port, you can flexibly add most shields on top of this Ethernet Shield. For more information, you can visit our [wiki page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/W5500_Ethernet_Shield_v1.0/).

### Features
+ High speed Ethernet controller W5200
+ SPI interface
+ 32 Kbytes inner buffer
+ Minimal RJ45 Ethernet port
+ Support up to eight simultaneous TCP/UDP connections
+ Handy SD card function
+ Grove ports for I2C and UART preformed
